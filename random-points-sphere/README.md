# Some experiments on random variables on hyperspheres.

1. Verifying that sampling N identical, independent Gaussians and normalizing yields a random variable that's uniformly distributed on the unit N-sphere. In addition, exploring what it is about the isotropic Gaussian that makes it critical to the only known method of sampling uniformly on the sphere.
    - Why Gaussians work: TODO

2. Verifying that the intuitive idea of simply sampling the higher-dimensional analogs of the azimuthal and polar angles in 3-D spherical coordinates uniformly does not produce a uniform distribution on the N-sphere, and seeing what the distribution does look like.

3. When sampling uniformly on the unit N-sphere, what does the distribution of each individual coordinate look like? In addition, uniformly sample on various high-dimensional unit spheres and project down to 2 or 3 dimensions, and see what the distribution looks like.
