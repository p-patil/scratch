# Some empricial experiments of the distributions of images, per classification label, in their high-dimensional space.

1. k-means, just for shits.

2. Looking at what the average image and average pixel per class look like.

3. Looking at the degree of separability or "mixing" between the images.

4. Trying to visualize the decision boundaries of various models on the images, from simple linear models to state-of-the-art CNNs.
